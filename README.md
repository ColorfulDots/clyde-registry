# Clyde Registry

The official registry for [Clyde](https://clydecommands.com), a macOS command launcher that acts as an intent dispatcher. It's an app that opens everything.

This repo is the source of truth for all user-commands and user-scripts available at **clydecommands.com/registry**. Every merged PR automatically appears on the site.

## What is a user-command?

A user-command is a single JSON file containing an array of related commands that Clyde loads from `~/.clyde/user-commands/`.

```json
{
  "id": "obsidian",
  "displayName": "Obsidian",
  "description": "Commands for your Obsidian vaults.",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "your-github-username",
  "homepage": "https://obsidian.md",
  "registry": "https://github.com/ColorfulDots/clyde-registry",
  "appStore": null,
  "color": "purple",
  "icon": "note.text",
  "tags": ["productivity", "notes"],
  "commands": [
    {
      "name": "Open Daily Journal",
      "keywords": ["journal", "daily", "obsidian"],
      "executor": "urlScheme",
      "target": "obsidian://daily",
      "description": "Open today's daily note in Obsidian"
    }
  ]
}
```

## What is a user-script?

A user-script is a shell script installed at `~/.clyde/user-scripts/`. Use scripts for interactive commands, multi-step flows, or anything that needs more than a single shell one-liner.

---

## Registry structure

```
official/
  user-commands/    ← JSON command modules
  user-scripts/     ← shell scripts
_template.json

```

All contributions go through a PR. Once approved and merged by the Clyde team, they appear in the registry.

## Security

The following patterns are **automatically blocked** by CI:

- `curl ... | bash` / `wget ... | bash`
- `rm -rf /`
- `dd if=` (disk writes)
- Fork bombs

Commands that download and execute arbitrary code will be rejected regardless of intent.
